So how do I do level 2 anyway?
==============================

Oh joy! Another binary! Just what you, our dear reader, was clearly looking for!
This binary is fortunately much smaller than the prior one, but less luckily,
has no magical password strings hidden inside it. However, it was programmed
terribly, and even running it should emit a warning about the particular
unsafe practices employed. A little bit of recon as to why the particular
practice used is terrible should quickly result in some directions for our
motivated reader to begin poking in, assisted by some hints given immediately
upon leveling up.
