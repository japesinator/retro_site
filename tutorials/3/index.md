So how do I do level 3 anyway?
==============================

The particularly analytic reader may have predicted the binary once again found
in the home directory, but may not have anticipated its failure to even run! The
simply awful programmer who wrote thing apparently did not understand memory
management, and as a result, the program will always crash right before printing
the password you, our dear reader, so desire. However, thanks to the wonders of
modern computing, the program could conceivably be somehow modified, so as not
to always terminate, or simply analyzed carefully and pieced back together. A
tool known as `objdump` may be of use here.
