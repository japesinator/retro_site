so how do i do level 0 anyway?
==============================

Level 0 is pretty much just meant to get you used to the style and format of
retrograde. If you've used a linux commandline before, you should pick up the
gist of what's going on pretty quick, and if you have never used a linux
commandline before, you will probably want to learn a bit about that before you
dive in to this (if you want to go for it anyway, we won't stop you, but it may
be rough.) [OverTheWire Bandit](http://overthewire.org/wargames/bandit/) is
really fun and a great introduction if you haven't used the commandline before.
