so how do i do level 4 anyway?
==============================

This final (for now) level offers its participants a seemingly impossible task:
guessing a completely random number which they cannot see. Even analysis of the
source code fails to yield anything, as the number is determined dynamically
each time! To solve this ultimate puzzle, the learned hacker must somehow
vivisect the program, tearing it apart while it still lives, and inspect the
stored number, then enter it to return the flag. One program known as `gdb` may
be extremely useful when judiciously applied here.
